Hey there! Welcome to my page. To get started, download my folder for the snake game (go to the green dropdown for code and download the ZIP file). Run main.X68 and press play to play my game. Remember to extract the files, otherwise the code will not work. You may need to download easy68K: http://www.easy68k.com/
